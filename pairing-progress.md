- **Navigation.tsx** - Updated with PAIRING tab and unpaired device count badge
- **App.tsx** - Complete integration supporting both paired and unpaired device views

#### 2. Tauri Commands Integration ✅
All Tauri commands implemented and integrated:
- `initiate_pairing(device_id)` - Start pairing with discovered device
- `confirm_pairing(session_id)` - User confirms PIN verification
- `reject_pairing(session_id, reason)` - User rejects pairing attempt
- `get_paired_devices()` - Retrieve all paired devices with metadata
- `get_active_pairing_sessions()` - Get ongoing pairing sessions with timers

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Cryptographic Security ✅
- **ED25519 Digital Signatures** - Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Secure Random PIN Generation** - Using OS-level entropy (OsRng)
- **Constant-time PIN Comparison** - Prevents timing attacks
- **Device Authentication** - Public key exchange and verification

### Session Management ✅
- **Automatic Timeouts** - 5-minute session expiration
- **State Validation** - Proper state transitions and error handling
- **Cleanup Mechanisms** - Expired session cleanup and memory management
- **Collision Avoidance** - PIN uniqueness within time windows

### Transfer Security ✅
- **Pairing Enforcement** - File transfers require device pairing
- **Real-time Validation** - Connection-time pairing status checks
- **Graceful Rejection** - Clear error messages for unpaired devices
- **Backward Compatibility** - Optional pairing mode for gradual migration
