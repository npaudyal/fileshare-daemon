# Simplified Transfer Fix - Single Stream Approach

## Problem
The parallel stream approach was causing multiple issues:
- Streams with no chunks were sending filenames and finishing immediately
- Receiver expected chunks from ALL streams, causing "stream finished early" errors
- Complex protocol negotiation between control and data streams

## Solution: Ultra-Fast Single Stream

Simplified to use **ONE optimized stream** for all transfers:

### Key Changes:
1. **Single Stream Only**: Eliminated parallel stream complexity
2. **Massive Buffer**: 64MB buffer (or file size if smaller) for maximum throughput  
3. **Simple Protocol**: Just `BLAZING_SINGLE|filename|size|path` + raw data
4. **No Delays**: Removed all artificial delays and waiting

### Performance Optimizations:
- **64MB read/write buffer** vs previous 16MB
- **Enhanced QUIC windows**: 256MB/stream, 2GB/connection  
- **No protocol negotiation overhead**
- **Instant transfer start**

## Expected Results:

✅ **No more "stream finished early" errors**  
✅ **Instant transfer initiation**  
✅ **Maximum single-stream throughput** (often faster than poorly coordinated parallel streams)  
✅ **Rock-solid reliability**

## Next Steps:
1. Test this single-stream approach for speed and reliability
2. If successful, can add back smart parallelism later (only when beneficial)

## File Modified:
- `src/quic/blazing_transfer.rs`: Simplified to use single stream with massive buffer

The motto: **"Make it work reliably first, then make it fast"**
