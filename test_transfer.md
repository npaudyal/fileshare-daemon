# Transfer Speed Test Results

## Optimizations Made:

1. **Removed startup delays:**
   - Eliminated 50ms delay after control message
   - Reduced all sleep times from 50ms to 10ms

2. **Improved protocol efficiency:**
   - Added magic bytes (0xFF for control, 0xFE for data) for instant stream type detection
   - No more trial-and-error parsing of stream headers

3. **Increased parallelism:**
   - Chunk size: 8MB → 16MB for better throughput
   - Max parallel streams: 32 → 64
   - Write concurrency: 64 → 128
   - Stream manager limits: 64 → 128 concurrent streams

4. **Enhanced QUIC configuration:**
   - Stream receive window: 100MB → 256MB
   - Connection window: 1GB → 2GB
   - Max concurrent streams: 1000 → 2000

5. **Fixed stream interpretation errors:**
   - Properly handle legacy streams with filename headers
   - Distinguish between filename length and chunk data
   - Better error recovery for malformed streams

## Expected Results:

- **Instant transfer start** (no 50ms+ delays)
- **No more "stream finished early" errors**
- **Blazing fast speeds** from the first second
- **Better CPU/network utilization** with increased parallelism

## Testing:

Run a file transfer and observe:
1. Transfer should start immediately (< 100ms)
2. No errors in receiver logs
3. Consistent high speed throughout transfer
