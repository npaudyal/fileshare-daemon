# File Transfer Progress UI - Phased Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document breaks down the File Transfer Progress UI implementation into independent phases that can be developed and tested separately.

## Phase 1: Backend Transfer Infrastructure
**Goal**: Create the core transfer tracking system

### Deliverables
- `src-tauri/src/transfer/mod.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/transfer/manager.rs` - Transfer state management
- `src-tauri/src/transfer/progress.rs` - Progress tracking utilities

### Key Features
- Transfer struct with ID, file info, progress, speed, status
- In-memory transfer registry
- Basic CRUD operations for transfers
- Event emission system for progress updates


## Phase 2: IPC Commands Layer
**Goal**: Implement Tauri commands for transfer operations

### Deliverables
Add commands to `main.rs`:
- `get_active_transfers` - Return current transfer states
- `toggle_transfer_pause` - Pause/resume specific transfer
- `cancel_transfer` - Cancel and cleanup transfer
- `open_transfer_window` - Spawn progress window

### Key Features
- Commands that interact with TransferManager from Phase 1
- Proper error handling and serialization
- Mock data for testing without actual transfers


## Phase 3: Transfer Window Management
**Goal**: Handle spawning and lifecycle of progress windows

### Deliverables
- `src-tauri/src/windows/mod.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/windows/transfer_window.rs`
- `transfer-progress.html` entry point

### Key Features
- Window creation with proper configuration
- Window positioning logic (center screen or near cursor)
- Auto-close behavior
- Window state management


## Phase 4: Frontend Progress UI
**Goal**: Build the transfer progress interface

### Deliverables
- `src/components/TransferProgressWindow.tsx` - Main window component
- `src/components/TransferProgressItem.tsx` - Individual transfer UI
- `src/transfer-progress.tsx` - App initialization

### Key Features
- Progress visualization components
- Event listeners for backend updates
- Action buttons (pause/resume/cancel)
- Native OS styling with blur effects


## Phase 5: Integration with Transfer Flow
**Goal**: Connect the progress UI to actual file transfers

### Deliverables
- Modified `paste_files` function in `daemon_quic.rs`
- Hook points in PeerManager for transfer events
- Progress emission during HTTP/QUIC transfers

### Key Features
- Create transfer records on paste
- Emit real progress during actual transfers
- Proper cleanup on completion
- Handle both HTTP and QUIC transfer methods

### Testing
- End-to-end transfer with progress window
- Verify progress accuracy
- Test multiple simultaneous transfers

---

## Phase 6: Enhanced Features & Polish
**Goal**: Add advanced features and error handling

### Deliverables
- Speed calculation and ETA estimation
- Pause/resume implementation
- Error states and retry logic
- Minimize/restore behavior
- Configuration options

### Key Features
- Moving average for speed calculation
- Robust error handling with clear messages
- Retry with exponential backoff
- User preferences (auto-close, position, etc.)
- Performance optimizations (throttled updates)

### Testing
- Stress testing with various scenarios
- Network interruption handling
- Large file transfers
- Multiple concurrent transfers

---

## Development Order

### Recommended Sequence
1. **Phase 1 & 2 together** - Build backend and IPC layer in parallel since they're closely related
2. **Phase 4** - Build the UI with mock data (can be done independently)
3. **Phase 3** - Add window management to display the UI
4. **Phase 5** - Integration is easier once all pieces exist
5. **Phase 6** - Polish and enhancements after core functionality works

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Backend Team**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 5
- **Frontend Team**: Phase 4 → Phase 3 → Phase 6
- **Integration Point**: Phase 5 brings both tracks together

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Use Tauri's state management for transfer registry
- Implement proper locking for concurrent access
- Clean up completed transfers after timeout

### Event System
- Use Tauri's event emission for real-time updates
- Throttle progress events to avoid overwhelming the UI
- Implement event namespacing for multiple windows

### Error Handling Strategy
- Network errors: Automatic retry with backoff
- User cancellation: Clean shutdown
- File system errors: Clear user messaging
- Peer disconnection: Graceful failure

### Performance Goals
- Progress updates max 10Hz
- Window spawn time < 100ms
- Memory usage < 50MB per window
- Smooth 60fps animations

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Checklist
- [ ] Phase 1: Transfer manager can track mock transfers
- [ ] Phase 2: All IPC commands respond correctly
- [ ] Phase 3: Window spawns and closes properly
- [ ] Phase 4: UI renders and responds to mock events
- [ ] Phase 5: Real transfers show live progress
- [ ] Phase 6: All edge cases handled gracefully
